      <h3>Cooking Chicken</h3>
      <div class="section">
           <p>4. Heat ghee or oil in a heavy bottom pot or pressure cooker. Make sure you use a large one for this. Using whole spices is optional but recommended. Use whatever you have. I use</p>
           <ul>
           <li>1 bay leaf</li>
           <li>green cardamoms</li>
           <li>6 cloves</li>
           <li>1 inch cinnamon piece</li>
           <li>1 star anise</li>
           <li> ¾ teaspoon shahi jeera (caraway seeds)</li>
           <li> strand mace</li>    
      </ul>

          <img src="../images/recipe4.jpg" alt="Pic of recipe">
          </div>
          <p>5. Add thinly sliced onions. On a medium heat, fry them stirring often until uniformly light brown. </p>
        </div class="section">
        <img src="../images/recipe5.jpg" alt="Pic of recipe">
      </div>
      <p>6. This is the correct color of the onions. Do not burn them as they leave a bitter taste.</p>
        </div class="section">
        <img src="../images/recipe6.jpg" alt="Pic of recipe">
        </div>
        <p>7. Add marinated chicken & saute until it becomes pale for 5 minutes.</p>
    </div class="section">
    <img src="../images/recipe7.jpg" alt="Pic of recipe">
    </div>
    <p>8. Lower the flame completely. Cover and cook until the chicken is soft, tender and completely cooked.</p>
    </div class="section">
    <img src="../images/recipe8.jpg" alt="Pic of recipe">
    </div>
    <p>9. Check if the chicken is cooked by pricking with a fork or knife. It has to be just cooked and not overdone. Evaporate any excess moisture left in the pot by cooking further without the lid.</p>
    </div class="section">
    <img src="../images/recipe9.jpg" alt="Pic of recipe">
    </div>
    <p>10. Taste test and add more salt if needed. I added ¼ more salt here. Add</p>

    <h3>Make Chicken Biryani</h3>   
    <div class="section">
    <p>11. Mix everything well. Spread it evenly in a single layer.</p> 
    </div class="section">
    <img src="../images/recipe11.jpg" alt="Pic of recipe">
    </div>
    <p>12. Layer drained rice all over the chicken. To a separate bowl, pour 3 cups water and add ¼ to ½ teaspoon salt. If cooking in a pot, start with 3 cups water at this stage.</p>

    <p>Stir and taste the water. It must be slightly salty. Pour 2 cups of this across the sides of the cooker or pot. Pour rest of the water over the rice gently.</p>
    <div class="section">
        <img src="../images/recipe12.jpg" alt="Pic of recipe">
        </div>
        <p>13. Level the rice gently on top. Add 2 tablespoons more mint leaves.Do not mix up everything, the taste of the biryani cooked in the shown method is good. Optionally you can sprinkle 2 tablespoons fried onions & saffron soaked milk.</p>
    <div class="section">
    <img src="../images/recipe13.jpg" alt="Pic of recipe">
    </div>
    <p>14. Finally cover the pot or cooker.</p>
    <p>If cooking in a pot, cook on a medium heat until the rice is done completely. If the rice is undercooked pour ¼ to ½ cup boiling water at this stage. How much to add depends on the quality of basmati rice. Cook covered until the biryani rice is perfectly done, grainy and fully cooked. Rest it covered for 15 mins.</p>
    <p>If cooking in a cooker, cook for 1 whistle. Later remove the cooker from the hot burner to stop cooking further.</p>
